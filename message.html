            <p>Anneliese and I were on our second date when she was 
              telling me about her roommate and how he helped her 
              create her Hinge profile. I could see on her face that 
              she was a little nervous about letting me know that she 
              lived with a guy but I assured her that I didn’t mind. 
              That was purely blind faith benefit of the doubt and it’s 
              been one of the best decisions I’ve made in our 
              relationship. Not only did I gain a girlfriend (now fiancé)
               but I also gained a great friend in you (and Megan, too!). 
               Whether we’re watching movies, going to Disney, playing 
               an <strong>escape</strong> room, walking around some kind of festival or 
               market, or spending time at church, it’s always a great 
               time when we’re together.
